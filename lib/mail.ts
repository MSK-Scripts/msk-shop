// The shop sends exactly one kind of mail today: the reminder that a free trial
// is about to end (see lib/emails/trialEnding.ts). Everything else the customer
// needs is either in the dashboard or comes from Stripe itself.
//
// Configuration lives in the environment (SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS, MAIL_FROM).
// If it is incomplete the module degrades to a no-op instead of throwing: a shop
// without mail credentials must still take orders, and a webhook must never fail
// because of a missing SMTP password.

/**
 * Make a value safe to write into a log line.
 *
 * A recipient address reaches this module from the withdrawal, cancellation and
 * report forms, which anyone can submit without signing in. A value carrying CR
 * or LF can forge additional log entries, and a very long one pushes real
 * entries out of view.
 *
 * The three forms do validate the address before it gets here (`lib/legalForms.ts`
 * collapses whitespace and then rejects anything that is not `user@host.tld`), so
 * this is not exploitable today. The guarantee would live three files away in
 * whichever validator a caller happened to use, though, and `sendMail` is a
 * shared helper whose next caller may not validate at all. The check belongs
 * where the value is written.
 *
 * Allow-list rather than block-list: printable ASCII plus everything from U+00A0
 * up, which keeps umlauts and every other real name intact while dropping the C0
 * controls, DEL and the C1 range. Written as a range so no literal control
 * character appears in the pattern.
 *
 * The two line-break replacements in front of it are redundant against that
 * range and stay anyway, for two reasons. The line break is the actual attack,
 * so naming it reads better than leaving someone to work out which code points
 * a range happens to exclude. And CodeQL accepts exactly one shape as a
 * sanitizer here, which took two attempts to get right:
 *
 *   exists(string s | this.(StringReplaceCall).replaces(s, "") and s.regexpMatch("\n"))
 *
 * A replace of a newline against the EMPTY string. Neither the negated
 * character class nor a replacement with a space satisfied it, and both came
 * back as the same finding. Dropping the character rather than substituting a
 * space is the better behaviour anyway: the value is an address, it has no
 * whitespace worth preserving, and inventing one would put something in the log
 * that the caller never sent.
